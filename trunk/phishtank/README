This is a very simple and naive phishtank.com filtering setup.

How it works:

* Fetch the index.xml file from phishtank.com:

  $ wget http://data.phishtank.com/data/online-valid/

  This produces index.xml.

* Run process.pl, which reads index.xml and writes out a Berkeley DB Hash
  database of URLs to match against, defaulting to 'phishtank'.

* Run dump.pl; make sure that the data is loaded into the Berkeley DB
  correctly.

* Configure a recent (as in, Squid-2.6 or Squid-3 released June 2007 or later)
  to use an external ACL helper. Something along these lines:


# This defines the external ACL; tells it where the database is, and
# defines the ACL name "phishacl" to use in ACL rules.
external_acl_type phishextacl %URI /home/adrian/work/squid/phishtank/phish_helper /home/adrian/work/squid/phishtank/phishtank
acl phishacl external phishextacl

# Put this in your ACL section before your 'permit' rules.
deny_info ERR_PHISHTANK_DENIED phishacl
http_access deny !phishacl 

* Copy the ERR_PHISHTANK_DENIED (English only, sorry!) into your
  language-specific error directory. The deny_info rule above
  will use that page; the page will display some basic information
  and give a link to the phishtank.com database entry.

* You can turn $debug to 1 in "phish_helper" to echo debug messages in
  Squid's 'cache.log' file. Turn it to 0 when you're happy its
  working.
