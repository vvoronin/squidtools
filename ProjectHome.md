This project is designed as a sort of "collection" of  odds and ends that I'm slowly acquiring which will hopefully be useful to others.

It may or may not eventually become part of the Lusca project.

Third parties are more than welcome to contribute their Squid related mini-projects here!

I'm licencing this BSD because I'd like to see people adopt these in any environment they see fit. I'd appreciate it though if people kept me informed if they were using em. :)
