This is a reimplementation of what I found "asqredir", something written
in C++ or something, which seemed to be horribly unstable and unmaintained.

The redir.pl script is very obvious and very simple. Its very dumb too;
the speed of the script depends on the number of lines in the file.
It doesn't try to combine them into larger regular expression patterns
for quicker matching.

	redir.pl	- The Squid redirector program
	redirect.txt	- The documentation and example configuration file
