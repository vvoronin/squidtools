0.03 (12 July 2007)
	* Migrate to using TDB, for simple multi-reader, single-writer
	* Do a full database rewrite every update cycle
	* phish_helper now periodically stat's the database file and reopens
	  it if it changes.

0.02 (8 July 2007)
	* Add Update script to periodically handle updates
	* Print out some statistics as the database is being generated/updated
	* Modify the code to use Perl's BerkeleyDB rather than NDBM;
	  BDB should allow us to run multiple-reader single-writer
	  without requiring invasive code changes (read: "environments"
	  in BDB's manual.)
