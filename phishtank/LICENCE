This is licenced just like MySQL; ie:

* If its part of a open source software project, where the software source
  is freely available - then this is licenced under the GPL.

* If its distributed as part of a commercial product, please contact
  Xenion Communications - via http://www.xenion.com.au/ for more
  information. I'm not going to charge a large amount to licence something
  which is (for now) so simple, but I'd prefer to know who is using this.

* No matter what, this software is provided "as-is" with no implied warranty
  or guarantee for suitability or functionality! The only way you'll get
  this is if you're paying for support.
